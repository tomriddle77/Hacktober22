You are always advised to make more than 4 pull requests
Suppose, you have made only 4 pull request to different projects
but due to some problem one project gets excluded from hackoctoberfest event then your pull request will not be counted towards HACKTOBERFEST contributions and 
then you will be remained with only 3 valid pull requests.
